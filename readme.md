# Mini Projects

This is the place where I publish small projects that are created during my exercises and practice.

I write my projects mostly in Jupyter Notebook, so please check the .ipnyb files.

Most of the data I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) but every project is linking to the source of datasets.

Each project is described inside. Below I will briefly summarize the most important points.

### [App Profiles](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/Apps%20Profile)

Folder contains analyze of applications available in leading app stores - Google Play and Apple Store. The project is focused on the most commonly used and preferred applications.

### [Exit Surveys](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/Exit%20surveys)
The link between age and dissatisfaction - exit surveys
This miniproject focus on cleaning and transformation data to find the answer. There are exit surveys from two institutions: Departament of Education, Training and Employent and Technical and Further Education.

### [Hackers News Posts](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/Hackers%20News%20Posts)

Inside I practice using datetime format, check the frequency of responses to users posts and calculate the average number of comments by hour.

### [SQL](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/SQL)

My labs with SQL. Database I am working with is this same as is the [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors). This data relate to the relationship between the completed direction and the subsequent consequences, such as earnings or unemployment.

### [VisualizeGenderGap](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/VisualizeGenderGap)

This exercise focuses on drawing graphs using the matplotlib library. The data being compared relate to differences in the achievement of Bachelor's degrees. They show which directions are dominated by women, which are dominated by men, and which are balanced.

### [VisualizeGeographicData](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/VisualizeGeographicData)

Here I'm learning the basics of the Basemap library. It contains data on airlines, airports and flight routes, which after calculation using the library allow to add points to the map of the world and draw routes.

### [Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors)

Visualization of earnings based on data from students who graduated from college in 2010-2012, using mainly scatterplots and histograms. Analysis of the best and worst paid fields of majors and comparison of women's and men's earnings by specialization.

### [World Happiness + Indicators](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/World%20Happiness%20%2B%20Indicators)

This folder contains two notebooks with data processing examples that use World Happiness files. I am looking and removing missing data, duplicated data and combine various information.

### [World Happiness](https://github.com/Ysbail/MiniProjects/tree/master/World%20Happiness)
