# Mini Projects

This is the place where I publish small projects that are created during my exercises and practice.

I write my projects mostly in Jupyter Notebook, so please check the .ipnyb files.

Most of the data I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) but every project is linking to the source of datasets.

Each project is described inside. Below I will briefly summarize the most important points.

### App Profiles

Folder contains analyze of applications available in leading app stores - Google Play and Apple Store. The project is focused on the most commonly used and preferred applications.

### Hackers News Posts

Inside I practice using datetime format, check the frequency of responses to users posts and calculate the average number of comments by hour.

### VisualizeGenderGap

This exercise focuses on drawing graphs using the matplotlib library. The data being compared relate to differences in the achievement of Bachelor's degrees. They show which directions are dominated by women, which are dominated by men, and which are balanced.
